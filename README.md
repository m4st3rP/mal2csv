# mal2csv
Python script to convert your MyAnimeList .xml export to a .csv file

1. Export your MyAnimeList to .xml at https://myanimelist.net/panel.php?go=export
2. Extract the .gz files and place the .xmls in the same location as the script mal2csv.py
3. Rename the exported files to 'animelist.xml' and 'mangalist.xml' (delete the numbers at the end of the filename).
4. Run the script.

Hope this helps and let me know if you run into any trouble!
